# Resume Revision Session — Progress Log
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** In progress — paused, ready to resume

---

## What We Are Doing

Revising Rodrigo's master resume for **Growth PM positioning**. The goal is to move away from a generalist headline ("Platform, E-commerce & AI Product Manager") toward a specialist Growth PM signal, based on market research confirming recruiters and ATS in 2025–2026 strongly favour focused professionals over generalists.

---

## Key Strategic Decisions (Already Made)

- **Target positioning:** Senior Growth Product Manager, specialising in e-commerce, checkout optimisation, and conversion
- **Not pursuing:** Generalist PM framing, AI PM framing (never discussed — do not introduce this)
- **Why specialist:** Market research from Consortia, The New Stack, Lenny's Newsletter confirms "we need someone who's done this exact thing before" is the dominant recruiter signal in 2025–2026
- **ATS principle:** Semantic analysis now used — keyword stuffing out, natural specialist language in

## What Is Still Open (Resume With Two Pending Decisions)

### 1. Headline — choose one:
- Option A (with domain): `Senior Growth Product Manager | E-Commerce & Conversion`
- Option B (clean title only): `Senior Growth Product Manager`

*Note: domain specialisation can be carried by summary + bullets if Option B chosen.*

### 2. Summary — draft ready, pending Rodrigo's approval:
> Senior Growth Product Manager with 8+ years specialising in e-commerce conversion, checkout optimisation, and funnel growth across Europe and LatAm. Delivers measurable outcomes in complex environments — B2B platforms, post-merger integrations, and multinational rollouts — through structured experimentation, cross-functional delivery, and data-driven iteration.

*Why this version:* Two sentences, positioning only, no metrics repeated from bullets (previous version was too long and duplicated numbers that appear in the body — agreed this was wrong).*

## Changes Made vs Original — Summary Table

| Section | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Headline | "Platform, E-commerce & AI PM" → TBD (see open items) | Specialist signal, market research |
| Summary | Full rewrite — shorter, positioning only, no repeated metrics | Previous was too long and duplicated bullet metrics |
| WFP Bullet 2 | "Defined" replaces passive framing, outcome foregrounded | Weak verb ("Presented" buried the action) |
| WFP Bullet 3 | "Owned" + "Drove" replace "Contributed" / "Supported" | Passive ownership signals |
| HELLA Bullet 1 | "Managed" → "Led", redundant "teams" removed | Stronger ownership, cleaner prose |
| Accenture Bullets 1+2 | Merged into one | Bullet 1 had zero outcome — pure activity |
| Accenture LatAm | "Managed" → "Delivered" | Stronger verb |
| C&A Bullet 1 | Dropped "Joined as PM focused on" | Filler phrase — role header says this already |
| C&A Bullet 2 | "Supported" → "Drove" | Passive ownership |
| Mollis | Removed "establishing foundational PM skills" | Self-assessed, weak |
| Certifications | Removed Blockchain Essentials (2019) | Irrelevant |
| Skills | Gemini 3 → Gemini, Codex → GitHub Copilot, removed Granola + Kilo Code, ML Training → ML Use Case Discovery and Validation | Accuracy and relevance |

## How to Resume This Session

Start a new Claude Code session and say:

> "I want to continue revising my master resume. Read `resume_revision_session.md` first and pick up from where we left off."

The two remaining decisions are headline (Option A vs B) and summary approval. Once those are done, the full revised resume is ready to be pasted back into Notion.
